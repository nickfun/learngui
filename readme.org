Sandbox to play with java gui tools

** Goals

1. Launch a GUI
2. Load a JSON file and manip the GUI with data from the file
3. Pressing GO will process the items from the USER list to the DONE list
4. Processing doesn't mean anything for this project, this is just to learn GUI stuff for a tool I want to build at work
